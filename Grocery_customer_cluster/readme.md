Company XYZ is an online grocery store. In the current version of the website, they have manually grouped the items into a few categories based on their experience.

However, they now have a lot of data about user purchase history. They want to do:

* The company founder wants to meet with some of the best customers to go through a focus group with them. You are asked to sent the ID of the following customers to the founder:
   * The customer who bought the most items overall in her lifetime
   * for each item, the customer who bought that product the most
* Cluster items based on user co-purchase history. That is, create cluster of products that have the highest probability of being bought together. The goal is to replace the old/manually created categories with these new ones. Each item can belong to just one cluster.
